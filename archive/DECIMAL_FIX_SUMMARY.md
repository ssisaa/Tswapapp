# Critical Decimal Fix Summary

## Problem Overview

The staking program has been experiencing critical decimal conversion issues that caused massive discrepancies between displayed rewards and actual tokens received:

1. **Initial Problem**: UI showed ~10x more than users received (UI: 2.4177 YOS, wallet: 0.2318 YOS)
2. **After First Fix**: UI showed small amounts but users received millions of tokens (UI: 3.6124 YOS, wallet: 349M YOS)

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was traced to three compounding problems:

1. **Incorrect Rate Denomination**: The program was using `/10000.0` to convert basis points to percentage, which didn't provide enough precision for the small per-second rate.

2. **Missing Token Unit Conversions**: The program wasn't properly handling the conversion between human-readable token amounts (with 9 decimals) and raw blockchain values.

3. **Calculation Error Amplification**: With larger token amounts and longer staking periods, these errors were massively amplified.

## Comprehensive Fix

The implemented solution makes these critical changes:

1. **Increased Precision**: Changed rate conversion from `/10000.0` to `/1_000_000.0` to properly handle very small per-second rates.

2. **Proper Token Unit Handling**: 
   - Converts staked amounts from raw to token units (`/ 1_000_000_000.0`) 
   - Performs calculations in human-readable token units
   - Converts results back to raw units for blockchain storage (`* 1_000_000_000.0`)

3. **Consistent Fix Application**: Fixed all affected functions:
   - `process_harvest` - For claiming rewards
   - `process_unstake` - For unstaking tokens and receiving rewards
   - `calculate_rewards` - Helper function for reward calculations

## Technical Implementation

```rust
// BEFORE
let rate_decimal = (program_state.stake_rate_per_second as f64) / 10000.0;
let raw_rewards = (staking_data.staked_amount as f64 * time_staked_seconds as f64 * rate_decimal) as u64;

// AFTER
// Convert rate with higher precision
let rate_decimal = (program_state.stake_rate_per_second as f64) / 1_000_000.0;

// Calculate in token units first
let rewards_token_units = (staking_data.staked_amount as f64 / 1_000_000_000.0) * 
                         (time_staked_seconds as f64) * 
                         rate_decimal;

// Convert back to raw units for blockchain
let raw_rewards = (rewards_token_units * 1_000_000_000.0) as u64;
```

## Expected Results

After deployment, users should see:

1. **Accurate Rewards**: The amounts shown in the UI should exactly match what users receive in their wallets.
2. **Consistent Calculations**: No more overflow errors or discrepancies regardless of token amounts or time periods.
3. **Transparent Logging**: The program now logs both human-readable and raw values for better transparency.
