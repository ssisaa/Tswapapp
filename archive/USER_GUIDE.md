## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How are staking rewards calculated?**
A: Rewards are calculated based on the number of YOT tokens staked, the time they've been staked, and the current staking rate set by the platform administrators.

**Q: Can I unstake at any time?**
A: Yes, you can unstake your YOT tokens at any time without penalties. Any accrued rewards will be harvested automatically when you unstake.

**Q: What fees does the platform charge?**
A: The platform charges a small fee on token swaps (0.3% by default). There are no fees for staking or unstaking.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do I need SOL in my wallet?**
A: SOL is required to pay for transaction fees on the Solana network. Even though you're interacting with YOT and YOS tokens, the transactions themselves require a small amount of SOL.

**Q: My transaction failed. What should I do?**
A: Common reasons for transaction failures include:
- Insufficient SOL for fees
- Network congestion
- Wallet connection issues

Try increasing your SOL balance, waiting a few minutes, or reconnecting your wallet.

**Q: How do I report a problem?**
A: Click the "Support" button in the footer or email support@yot-platform.com with details about your issue.

### Security Questions

**Q: Is my wallet safe when connected to the platform?**
A: Yes, we never store your private keys. The platform only requests transaction signatures from your wallet, which you must approve for each action.

**Q: How can I secure my account?**
A: Follow these security best practices:
- Use a hardware wallet if possible
- Never share your seed phrase
- Disconnect your wallet when not using the platform
- Be cautious of phishing attempts
