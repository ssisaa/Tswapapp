// CRITICAL FIX V4: Update frontend reward calculations to match Solana program
// Using compound interest with proper scaling for APY

/**
 * Implementation Requirements:
 * 
 * 1. The Solana program will use EXACTLY this same formula:
 *    - Convert staking_rate from basis points to decimal (รท 1,000,000)
 *    - Convert from percentage to decimal (รท 100)
 *    - Calculate using compound formula: principal * ((1 + rate)^time - 1)
 * 
 * 2. The key fix in the Solana program is:
 *    - Rates must be properly scaled (รท 100) to get actual decimal rates
 *    - Apply compound interest after proper scaling
 *    - This ensures that UI shows the same values as what users receive
 */

// Example usage:
/*
// IMPORTANT: stakeRatePerSecond is in percentage per second (e.g., 0.00000125%)
// We need to convert it to a decimal rate by dividing by 100
const stakeRateDecimal = stakeRatePerSecond / 100;  

const pendingRewards = calculatePendingRewards({
  stakedAmount: userStakingData.stakedAmount,
