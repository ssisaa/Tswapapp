# Multihub Swap V3 Update

This document provides an overview of the V3 update to the Multihub Swap system, which addresses key issues from previous versions.

## Key Improvements

The V3 update introduces several critical improvements to the Multihub Swap system:

1. **Smart Contract-Level Token Account Validation**:
   - YOS token accounts are now validated directly by the contract
   - Prevents transaction failures due to missing token accounts

2. **Admin Control Functionality**:
   - Added `CloseProgram` instruction for resetting the program state
   - Enables easier recovery from edge cases and reinitialization

3. **Automatic Token Account Creation**:
   - Client code now automatically detects and creates missing token accounts
   - Creates accounts in a separate transaction before the swap

4. **Fresh Program ID**:
   - Deployed with a completely new program ID: `Cohae9agySEgC9gyJL1QHCJWw4q58R7Wshr3rpPJHU7L`
   - Avoids conflicts with previous deployments and cached data

## Implementation Details

### Smart Contract Changes

The V3 contract includes several key architectural improvements:

```rust
// YOS token account validation in the swap instruction
if let Ok(user_yos_account_data) = TokenAccount::unpack(&user_yos_account.data.borrow()) {
    if user_yos_account_data.mint != program_state.yos_mint {
        msg!("YOS token account has incorrect mint");
        return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
    }
    if user_yos_account_data.owner != *user_account.key {
        msg!("YOS token account has incorrect owner");
        return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
    }
} else {
    msg!("Invalid YOS token account - account may not exist");
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
}
```

This validation ensures that token accounts exist and are correctly configured before proceeding with the swap operation.

### Client Integration

The client integration layer has been redesigned to handle account preparation:

```typescript
// Prepare all necessary token accounts
const setupResult = await prepareForSwap(
  connection,
  wallet,
  inputMint,
  outputMint
);

// If accounts need to be created first, do that in a separate transaction
if (setupResult.needsSetup) {
  console.log('Creating missing token accounts first...');
  const setupSignature = await wallet.sendTransaction(setupResult.transaction, connection);
  await connection.confirmTransaction(setupSignature, 'confirmed');
}
```

This two-step process ensures that all accounts exist before attempting the swap.

## Deployment

The V3 contract was deployed via Solana Playground to ensure compatibility with the Solana devnet. The deployment process:

1. Built the program in Solana Playground
2. Generated a new program ID: `Cohae9agySEgC9gyJL1QHCJWw4q58R7Wshr3rpPJHU7L`
3. Deployed to Solana devnet

## Admin Interface

A new admin interface was added at path `/multihub-v3-admin` that provides:

- Program initialization controls
- Program reset functionality
- Configuration visibility

## Initialization Parameters

The program uses the following default parameters:

| Parameter             | Value | Description               |
|-----------------------|-------|---------------------------|
| LP Contribution Rate  | 20%   | Contribution to liquidity |
| Admin Fee Rate        | 0.1%  | Fee for admin operations  |
| YOS Cashback Rate     | 3%    | YOS token cashback amount |
| Swap Fee Rate         | 0.3%  | Fee for swap operations   |
| Referral Rate         | 0.5%  | Fee for referrals         |

- [SOLANA_PLAYGROUND_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md](./SOLANA_PLAYGROUND_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md) - Guide for deploying via Solana Playground
- [MULTIHUB_SWAP_V3_GUIDE.md](./MULTIHUB_SWAP_V3_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive guide to the V3 implementation

## Usage

To use the V3 version:

1. Initialize the program with the admin wallet
2. Navigate to the swap interface
3. The integration will automatically use the V3 program

The V3 program is now the recommended version for all token swap operations.
