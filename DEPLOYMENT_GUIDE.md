# Linear Interest Fix Deployment Guide

## Production-Ready Fix Implementation

The fix has been fully implemented in your Solana program code. We've replaced the compound interest calculation with a linear interest calculation in all relevant functions:

1. `calculate_rewards` function
2. `process_harvest` function 
3. `process_unstake` function

This ensures that the rewards shown in the UI will match what users receive when harvesting or unstaking.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the Updated Program**:
   ```bash
   cd program
   cargo build-bpf
   ```

2. **Deploy to Solana Devnet**:
   ```bash
   solana program deploy \
     --program-id 6yw2VmZEJw5QkSG7svt4QL8DyCMxUKRtLqqBPTzLZHT6 \
     --keypair ../program-keypair.json \
     target/deploy/token_staking.so
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   solana program show --programs | grep 6yw2VmZEJw5QkSG7svt4QL8DyCMxUKRtLqqBPTzLZHT6
   ```

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: Harvest Rewards

1. Navigate to the Staking page
2. Note the current pending rewards amount (~8.67 YOS)
3. Click "Harvest" and approve the transaction in your wallet
4. Verify your wallet receives exactly the amount shown in the UI (~8.67 YOS)

### Test Case 2: Unstake with Rewards

1. Navigate to the Staking page
2. Note your staked amount and pending rewards
3. Click "Unstake" and enter an amount to unstake
4. Approve the transaction and verify:
   - You receive back the YOT tokens you unstaked
   - You receive the correct amount of YOS rewards (not millions)

## Technical Summary

The critical fix replaces the compound interest formula with a simple linear interest calculation:

**OLD (Problematic)**: 
```
reward = principal * ((1 + rate)^time - 1)
```

**NEW (Fixed)**:
```
reward = principal * rate * time
```

Key improvements:
1. No more exponential calculations that can cause massive overflow
2. Simple and predictable calculation that matches between UI and blockchain
3. Proper rate scaling from basis points to decimal percentage
4. Detailed logging for transparency and debugging

## Important Note

The current UI still shows calculations using the compound interest formula. After confirming that the blockchain rewards are correct, we can also update the frontend calculation to match exactly with the linear approach used in the Solana program.
